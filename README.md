# Invoice_OOP-principles


I developed this code based on the statement of this exercise, to showcase encapsulation, abstraction, and modularity using attributes and methods, in order to understanding of OOP concepts.


Create a class called `Invoice` that can be used by a computer supplies store to represent an invoice for an item sold in the store. An invoice should include the following information as attributes:

1. The item number being invoiced.
2. The item description.
3. The quantity of the item purchased.
4. The unit price of the item.

Your class should also contain a constructor that initializes these four attributes. If the item quantity is not positive, it should be set to 0. Provide a set method and a get method for each instance variable.

Furthermore, provide a method called `getInvoiceAmount` that calculates the invoice amount (i.e., multiplies the quantity by the item price) and then returns the value as a `double`. Write a test that demonstrates the capabilities of the `Invoice` class.
